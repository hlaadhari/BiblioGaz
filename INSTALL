If you are a developer, you should take a look at koha-testing-docker or KohaDevBox:
https://gitlab.com/koha-community/koha-testing-docker
https://gitlab.com/koha-community/kohadevbox

To start Koha in Docker, follow these steps:
1. Run the stack with:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. Ensure that the `etc/koha-conf.xml` file is properly configured to point to the MySQL database of the `db` service (host `db`, user `koha`, etc.).
   If needed, I can generate an example of this file adapted to Docker.

Do you want an example of a ready-to-use `koha-conf.xml` file for Docker?
